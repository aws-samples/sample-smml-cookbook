    "\n",
    "Now that we understand HOW sharding is done, we can understand how this tool is utilized by  libaries to optimize your model inference/training across multiple accelerators. If you want a deeper dive on individual sharding patterns that make up parallism patterns, and the collectives associated with them, we highly recommend [this chapter](https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/sharding/) of **How to Scale your Model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook though, we will focus on the different parallism strategies that can be implemented by these libaries, and what the considerations with them are.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallism Patterns\n",
    "This lab will be a hands on representation of common parallism patterns. If you want a achemic deep dive, we suggest you read through [The Ultra-Scale Playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook?section=high_level_overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note we will be using Deepspeed here but this could just as easily be done with any distributed inference/training framework, they have similar interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be covering the following:\n",
    "- Data Parallism\n",
    "- Tensor Parallism (Like we covered last chapter)\n",
    "- Pipeline Parallism\n",
    "- ZeRO-3/FSDP (these can be interchangable in most contexts)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other strategies as well, and likely more will emerge, but these are the main ones and others will follow similar concepts. Throughout the first part of this module we'll still be using a small model to demonstrate different types of parallism. At the end we will combine these strategies to run a much larger model on the same instance!\n",
    "\n",
    "The concepts we cover in this module can scale to thousands of GPUs.\n",

    "Great! As you can see distributed data can allow us to process our workload much faster, this is similar to how we previously used batching to improove price/performance. Here we can do something similar. But once our model is large enough this stragegy will no longer work, and we'll run into the same issues as before. So we'll have to find ways to either reduce the model size or reduce the training states (in most cases both)."

    "### ZeRO-3/FSDP\n",
    "![](./assets/zero.png)\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "ZeRO-3 (and FSDP) shards all model states — including parameters, gradients, and optimizer states — across GPUs. It avoids redundancy by ensuring that no GPU holds a full copy of the model. Parameters are temporarily reconstructed using AllGather at compute time.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Advantages:\n",
    "- Shards the entire model, including non-linear layers, embeddings, and optimizer states\n",
    "- Enables training models that exceed per-GPU memory\n",
    "- Integrates with existing PyTorch models via FSDP or DeepSpeed ZeRO\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Requires full parameter AllGather before each forward/backward step\n",
    "- Communication-intensive (especially with many GPUs)\n",
    "- Can be slower without high-bandwidth interconnect (e.g., NVLink or InfiniBand)\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will often stack ZeRO-3/FSDP with other strategies like Tensor and Data Parallelism. For example, we may shard linear layers with TP while still using ZeRO-3 to handle the remaining memory overhead from unsharded layers and optimizer state. This allows us to scale across both memory and compute bottlenecks."

    "Individual layers are sharded across GPUs — e.g., split matrix rows/columns in linear layers. Typically this requires a custom implementation of the model for parallism. This is usually done for popular models by frameworks like Pytorch and Deepspeed, but keep this in mind when using cutting edge models or creating your own, if the architecure is unique the model definition will need to account for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Advantages:\n",
    "- Enables sharding of very large models/layers\n",
    "- Reduces per-GPU memory usage\n",
    "- Exploits fine-grained parallelism within layers\n",
    "- Less CC than CC heavy DP\n",
    "- Reduces compute\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Requires deep model rewrites or tools like DeepSpeed/FSDP\n",
    "- Requires custom communication (e.g., all_gather, reduce_scatter)\n",
    "- CC (e.g., NCCL) can dominate runtime if not optimized or scaled too high\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will stack types of parallism on top of each other as by themselves they may not be enough to to store in memory. For example, we will stack DP and TP in this case. You will see DP, and TP moving forward as well."
